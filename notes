package manager:
NPM
JSPM
bower

web server:
http-server (static resources)
live-server (static resources + changes visible live)
express (static + API in node + configurable) vs koa vs hapi
budo (integrated with browserify + hot reloading)
webpack (serves from memory Â° hot reloading)
browsersync (dedicated ip + all interaction are in sync in instances of the loaded app, google for cross-device testing + integrated with webpack, browserify, Gulp ...)

rendring engine:
vash
jade

sharing work in progress :
localtunnel (create a hole in the firewall and uses a public proxy to forward to your app)
ngrok ( same but more secure : uses autentification (token))
now (upload app to the cloud (static + node modules))
surge (same but just static)

automation:
grunt
gulp
npm scripts

Transpilers:
Babel (standarized JS)
Typescript (type support : enhance autocompletion and safe refactoring + add non standard features)
Elm (new lang, functional paradigm, supposedly impossible to have runtime error)

Module formats:
Globals
IIFE
CJS (CommonJS)
AMD
UMD
ES6
SJS (SystemJS)

bundlers:
webpack (loaders (CSS, images, fonts), hot-reloading web server, version2 have tree shaking)
browserify (bundles npm package, plugins (minification, linting, tranpling ..))
rollup (NEW, tree shaking, faster loading : all module in one scope compared to inline module loader) ???!!
JSPM

webpack - Questions:
devtool: 'inline-source-map', // ????
publicPath ??

Linters:
JSLint (first ... created by Crockford Douglas)
JSHint (improvement over JSLint + configurability)
ESLint (De facto standard)
TSLint (For typescript)

ESLint - decisions:
1- Config format (.eslintrc (.js, .yaml, .yml, .json) or package.json)
2- Which built-in rules? http://eslint.org/docs/rules/
3- Warning or errors
4- Which plugins https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint
5- Use preset instead (From scratch, Recommanded (bit.ly/jsdeveslint), Presets(airbnb, standard JS, XO))

run eslint form command each time you save
use eslint-loader (Webpack)
use eslint-watch (npm package)

babel-eslint (for linting experimental features - stage 0-4)
